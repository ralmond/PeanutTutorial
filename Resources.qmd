## These Web Pages

These web pages are available in both a static version (<https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial>) and a source version (<https://github.com/ralmond/PeanutTutorial>).

The easiest way to access the Peanut tutorial is to use [R Studio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).  Go to new project, and select "From Version control", then "Git" then put 'https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/ralmond/PeanutTutorial.git' in the 'Repository URL' box.

The `.qmd` files contain a mixture of text and R code.  You will need
to download the `quarto` package for these to work properly, but R Studio will guide you through this.

## Netica

There are a number of packages that will do the basic Bayesian network
computations. For the purposes of this tutorial, we are using
[Netica](https://norsys.com)â“‡. Netica is available in two versions: a
graphical user interface (GUI) version and an application programmers
interface (API). We will use both in this class.

Netica also comes in both a free (but not open source) version and a
paid version. The paid version is used by purchasing an unlock code
from Norsys. The free version is specifically for training and
evaluation. It is limited in the size of the networks, but it has
sufficient capacity for most of the exercises in this tutorial.

-   Go to `https://norsys.com` and download the latest version of `Netica.exe`.
-   Unix/linux users: `Netica.exe` runs without major problems under Wine.
-   Mac OS Intell -- I have built a wineskin version of `Netica.exe`.  It is available at <https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/MacNetica2.app.zip>.
-   Mac OS ARM -- ???


## Peanut and RNetia

The R package `RNetica` provides an R binding of the Netica API
(hence, it requires the API and not GUI license). `RNetica` is
available at <https://ralmond.r-universe.dev/> (source code is at
<https://github.com/ralmond/>).

If you have not already done so, we recommend downloading [R
Studio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), in the
process of installing R Studio, you will need to install R itself
(\<https://cloud.r-project.org/).

Once you have R installed, you can install `RNetica` and running
related packages by running the following code:

```{r InstallRNetica}
if (!require('PNetica')) 
  install.packages(c('CPTtootls','RNetica','Peanut','PNetica'),
                   repos = c('https://ralmond.r-universe.dev',    'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

This bundle contains the following packages:

-   `CPTtools` --- A collection of functions for making conditional probability tables. (Does not depend on Netica.)
-   `RNetica` --- An R binding of the Netica API. Note that the installer downloads and installs Netica, so cognizant of the Netica License.
-   `Peanut` --- An object oriented layer for working with parameterized networks (`PNet`s).\
-   `PNetica` --- All of the Netica specific implementation of the `Peanut` protocol.

The intention is that `Peanut` (and `CPTtools`) are open
implementation protocols that are independent of the specific Bayes
net implementation. I'm currently looking for volunteers to build the
equivalent of `PNetica` for other Bayes net engines.

## Sample Networks.

The following zip files contain the sample networks used in the
tutorial.  (If you have downloaded the complete tutorial from github,
you have already downloaded these and can skip this step.)

* [IntroNets.zip](https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial/IntroNets.zip)  Used in Session 1
* [CompensatoryConjunctiveNets.zip](https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial/CompensatoryConjunctiveNets.zip)  Used in Session 2
* [miniACED](https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial/miniACED.zip)  Used in Session 3a
* [LearningNets](https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial/LearningNets.zip)  Used in Session ??
* [DBNExamples](https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial/DBNExamples.zip) Used in Session 4

Download these and unzip them in the directory from which you will be running R.

(If you put them somewhere else, you may need to adjust scripts to point to the right directory.)
