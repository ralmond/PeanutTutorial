------------------------
Note for MacOS users.

An older version of Netica is available for Mac OS Classic.  This
means that (a) it will not run on new Intel Macs and (b) Classic must
be installed on your machine in order for it to run.  This is an older
version which lacks the features necessary to do the last exercise.

In order to get Netica to recognize the files, you may need to
double-click on them in the Finder.
