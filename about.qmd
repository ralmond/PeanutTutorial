## Origin and History

This website is the latest iteration of the notes for the long running series of tutorial *Bayesian Networks in Eductional Assessment*, which has run at the [National Committee for Measurement in Education (NCME)](https://ncme.org/) since 2002. It complements the book *Bayesian Networks in Educational Assessment* available from Springer.

The original version was developed by Russell Almond, Bob Mislevy, Duanli Yan and David Williamson with assistance from Linda Steinberg and supported by Educational Testing service.

Over the years, others have contributed materials. In particular, Russell Almond (now at Florida State University), Roy Levy (Arizona State University) and Diego Zapata (Educational Testing Service).

Special thanks to Val Shute (ETS and FSU) for letting us used ACED data and models in this tutorial. ACED development and data collection was sponsored by National Science Foundation Grant No. 0313202. Complete data available at: http://ecd.ralmond.net/ecdwiki/ACED/ACED

## Current Presenters

![Russell Almond](img/RGAhead.jpg) 
Russell Almond is an Associate Professor of Measurement and Statistics at Florida State University. He has long been interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and statistics. With Bob Mislevy and Linda Steinberg he developed the initial version of evidence-centered assessment design (ECD). His home page is at <https://ralmond.net>, and he adminsters the machine <https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu>. His R packages are available through <https://ralmond.r-universe.net> and the source code is at <https://github.com/ralmond>, and his Mastadon handle is `@ralmond@mlhangout`.

## Acknowledgements

We have a lot of people to thank in the making of this tutorial. Obviously Bob and David played big roles in the development of the original tutorials (and we are still using some of their slides). They also helped with the planning for this 2nd edition. Linda Steinberg was extremely important in the original development of both evidence-centered assessment design and many of the original applications using Bayesian networks, particularly Biomass. Here project management skills drove us to find practical problems for many issues. Val Shute has generously offered us the Bayesian networks and data from here ACED project to use as examples. Brent Boerlage \@ Norsys has generously provided us with time-limited keys for Netica (although many of the class exercises can be done with the student version). More information about both the Netica GUI and API (needed for RNetica to work) can be found at <http://norsys.com/>. ETS has generously covered the cost of printing and shipping the paper copies of the slides and Springer has been helpful in arranging for copies of the book *Bayesian Networks in Educational Assessment* to be available at the tutorial. Last but not least, we would like to thank the NCME staff and volunteers for arranging a host of important details without which this would be a much less pleasant version.

Finally, we want to thank all of you who have come to the tutorial over the past decade. Your questions and feedback have helped us mold the tutorial to better meet the needs of the NCME audience. We hope that you will continue to provide us with questions and feedback.
