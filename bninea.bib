  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have shown that self-explanation is an effective metacognitive
 strategy, but how can it be leveraged to improve students' learning
 in actual classrooms? How do instructional treatments that emphasizes
 self-explanation affect students' learning, as compared to other
 instructional treatments? We investigated whether self-explanation
 can be scaffolded effectively in a classroom environment using a
 Cognitive Tutor, which is intelligent instructional software that
 supports guided learning by doing. In two classroom experiments,
 we found that students who explained their steps during problem-solving
 practice with a Cognitive Tutor learned with greater understanding
 compared to students who did not explain steps. The explainers better
 explained their solutions steps and were more successful on transfer
 problems. We interpret these results as follows: By engaging in explanation,
 students acquired better-integrated visual and verbal declarative
 knowledge and acquired less shallow procedural knowledge, The research
 demonstrates that the benefits of self-explanation can be achieved
 in a relatively simple computer-based approach that scales well for
 classroom use. (C) 2002 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. All rights

  Abstract                 = {Objective: This manuscript describes the development of a general
 intelligent tutoring system for teaching visual classification problem
 solving. Materials and methods: The approach is informed by cognitive
 theory, previous empirical work on expertise in diagnostic problem-solving,
 and our own prior work describing the development of expertise in
 pathology. The architecture incorporates aspects of cognitive tutoring
 system and knowledge-based system design within the framework of
 the unified problem-solving method description language component
 model. Based on the domain ontology, domain task ontology and case
 data, the abstract problem-solving methods of the expert model create
 a dynamic solution graph. Student interaction with the solution graph
 is filtered through an instructional layer, which is created by a
 second set of abstract problem-solving methods and pedagogic ontologies,
 in response to the current state of the student model. Results: In
 this paper, we outline the empirically derived requirements and design
 principles, describe the knowledge representation and dynamic solution
 graph, detail the functioning of the instructional layer, and demonstrate
 two implemented interfaces to the system. Conclusion: Using the general
 visual classification tutor, we have created SlideTutor, a tutoring
 system for microscopic diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of skin.

  Abstract                 = {Introduction We developed and evaluated a Natural Language Interface
 (NLI) for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in Diagnostic Pathology.
 The system teaches residents to examine pathologic slides and write
 accurate pathology reports while providing immediate feedback on
 errors they make in their slide review and diagnostic reports. Residents
 can ask for help at any point in the case, and will receive context-specific
 feedback. Research questions We evaluated (1) the performance of
 our natural language system, (2) the effect of the system on learning
 (3) the effect of feedback timing on learning gains and (4) the effect
 of ReportTutor on performance to self-assessment correlations. Methods
 The study uses a crossover 2 x 2 factorial design. We recruited 20
 subjects from 4 academic programs. Subjects were randomly assigned
 to one of the four conditions-two conditions for the immediate interface,
 and two for the delayed interface. An expert dermatopathologist created
 a reference standard and 2 board certified AP/CP pathology fellows
 manually coded the residents' assessment reports. Subjects were given
 the opportunity to self grade their performance and we used a survey
 to determine student response to both interfaces. Results Our results
 show a highly significant improvement in report writing after one
 tutoring session with 4-fold increase in the learning gains with
 both interfaces but no effect of feedback timing on performance gains.
 Residents who used the immediate feedback interface first experienced
 a feature learning gain that is correlated with the number of cases
 they viewed. There was no correlation between performance and self-assessment
 in either condition.},

  Abstract                 = {When populations are cross-classified with respect to two or more
 classifications or polytomies, questions often arise about the degree
 of association existing between the several polytomies. Most of the
 traditional measures or indices of association are based upon the
 standard chi-square statistic or on an assumption of underlying joint
 normality. In this paper a number of alternative measures are considered,
 almost all based upon a probabilistic model for activity to which
 the cross-classification may typically lead. Only the case in which
 the population is completely known is considered, so no question
 of sampling or measurement error appears. We hope, however, to publish
 before long some approximate distributions for sample estimators
 of the measures we propose, and approximate tests of hypotheses.
 Our major theme is that the measures of association used by an empirical
 investigator should not be blindly chosen because of tradition and
 convention only, although these factors may properly be given some
 weight, but should be constructed in a manner having operational
 meaning within the context of the particular problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Intelligent tutoring systems are highly interactive learning environments
 that have been shown to improve upon typical classroom instruction.
 Cognitive Tutors are a type of intelligent tutor based on cognitive
 psychology theory of problem solving and learning. Cognitive Tutors
 provide a rich problem-solving environment with tutorial guidance
 in the form of step-by-step feedback, specific messages in response
 to common errors, and on-demand instructional hints. They also select
 problems based on individual student performance. The learning benefits
 of these forms of interactivity are supported, to varying extents,
 by a growing number of results from experimental studies. As Cognitive
 Tutors have matured and are being applied in new subject-matter areas,
 they have been used as a research platform and, particularly, to
 explore interactive methods to support metacognition. We review experiments
 with Cognitive Tutors that have compared different forms of interactivity
 and we reinterpret their results as partial answers to the general
 question: How should learning environments balance information or
 assistance giving and withholding to achieve optimal student learning?
 How best to achieve this balance remains a fundamental open problem
 in instructional science. We call this problem the ``assistance dilemma{''}
 and emphasize the need for further science to yield specific conditions
 and parameters that indicate when and to what extent to use information
 giving versus information withholding forms of interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a methodology for constructing and evaluating models for
 adaptive informal technology-enhanced workplace learning. It is designed
 for knowledge-intensive work domains which are not pre structured
 according to a fixed curriculum. We extend research on Competence-based
 Knowledge Space Theory which has been mainly applied in educational
 settings. Our approach employs systematic knowledge elicitation and
 practically feasible evaluation techniques performed as part of the
 modelling process for iterative refinement of the models. A case
 study was performed in the Requirements Engineering domain to apply
 and test the developed methodology. We discuss lessons learned and
 several implications for knowledge engineering for adaptive workplace
 learning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 is discussed, A review of related work is made, and then the structural
 model is defined. Two of the most commonly cited reasons for not
 using Bayesian networks in student modeling are the computational
 complexity of the algorithms and the difficulty of the knowledge
 acquisition process, We propose an approach to simplify knowledge
 acquisition. Our approach applies causal independence to factor the
 conditional probabilities and decrease the parameters required for
 each question to a number linear in the number of concepts, This
 also provides the new parameters with an intuitive meaning that makes
 their specification easier. Finally, we present an example to illustrate
 the use of our approach.},

 based on the use of Bayesian Networks and Computer Adaptive Tests.
 A new integrated Bayesian student model is defined and then combined
 with an Adaptive Testing algorithm. The structural model defined
 has the advantage that it measures students' abilities at different
 levels of granularity, allows substantial simplifications when specifying
 the parameters (conditional probabilities) needed to construct the
 Bayesian Network that describes the student model, and supports the
 Adaptive Diagnosis algorithm. The validity of the approach has been
 tested intensively by using simulated students. The results obtained
 show that the Bayesian student model has excellent performance in
 terms of accuracy, and that the introduction of adaptive question
 selection methods improves its behavior both in terms of accuracy
 and efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Educational test theory consists of statistical and methodological
 tools to support inference about examinees' knowledge, skills, and
 accomplishments. Its evolution has been shaped by the nature of users'
 inferences, which have been framed almost exclusively in terms of
 trait and behavioral psychology, and focused on students' tendency
 to act in prespecified ways in prespecified domains of tasks. Progress
 in the methodology of test theory enabled users to extend the range
 of inference and ground interpretations more solidly within these
 psychological paradigms. Developments in cognitive and developmental
 psychology have broadened the range of inferences we wish to make
 about students' learning to encompass conjectures about the nature
 and acquisition of their knowledge. The same underlying principles
 of inference that led to standard test theory can support inference
 in this broader universe of discourse. Familiar models and methods-sometimes
 extended, sometimes reinterpreted sometimes applied to problems wholly
 different from those for which they were first devised-can play a
 useful role to this end.},

  Abstract                 = {For 25 years, we have been working to build cognitive models of mathematics,
 which have become a basis for middle- and high-school curricula.
 We discuss the theoretical background of this approach and evidence
 that the resulting curricula are more effective than other approaches
 to instruction. We also discuss how embedding a well specified theory
 in our instructional software allows us to dynamically evaluate the
 effectiveness of our instruction at a more detailed level than was
 previously possible. The current widespread use of the software is
 allowing us to test hypotheses across large numbers of students.
 We believe that this will lead to new approaches both to understanding
 mathematical cognition and to improving instruction.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian networks are frequently used in educational assessments primarily
 for learning about students' knowledge and skills. There is a lack
 of works on assessing fit of Bayesian networks. This article employs
 the posterior predictive model checking method, a popular Bayesian
 model checking tool, to assess fit of simple Bayesian networks. A
 number of aspects of model fit, those of usual interest to practitioners,
 are assessed using various diagnostic tools. This article suggests
 a direct data display for assessing overall fit, suggests several
 diagnostics for assessing item fit, suggests a graphical approach
 to examine if the model can explain the association among the items,
 and suggests a version of the Mantel-Haenszel statistic for assessing
 differential item functioning. Limited simulation studies and a real
 data application demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested model
 diagnostics.}

  Abstract                 = {User modelling shells and learner modelling servers have been proposed
 in order to provide reusable user/student model information over
 different domains, common inference mechanisms, and mechanisms to
 handle consistency of beliefs from different sources. Open and inspectable
 student models have been investigated by several authors as a means
 to promote student reflection, knowledge awareness, collaborative
 assessment, self-assessment, interactive diagnosis, to arrange groups
 of students, and to support the use of students' models by the teacher.
 This paper presents SModel, a Bayesian student modelling server used
 in distributed multi-agent environments. SModel server includes a
 student model database and a Bayesian student modelling component.
 SModel provides several services to a group of agents in a CORBA
 platform. Users can use ViSMod, a Bayesian student modelling visualization
 tool, and SMV, a student modelling database viewer, to visualize
 and inspect distributed Bayesian student models maintained by SModel
 server. SModel has been tested in a multi-agent tutoring system for
 teaching basic Java programming. In addition, SModel server has been
 used to maintain and share student models in a study focussed on
 exploring the existence of student reflection and analysing student
 model accuracy using inspectable Bayesian student models. (C) 2004

  Abstract                 = {In certain data analyses (e.g., multiple discriminant analysis and
 multinomial log-linear modeling), classification decisions are made
 based on the estimated posterior probabilities that individuals belong
 to each of several distinct categories. In the Bayesian network literature,
 this type of classification is often accomplished by assigning individuals
 to the modal state, based on the estimated posterior probabilities.
 This procedure is not satisfactory, however, when various types of
 classification errors have different costs. For example, Lenaburg
 used Bayesian network methods to forecast students' grades in a college
 statistics course to identify students who were likely to benefit
 from extra tutoring, and was most concerned with incorrectly predicting
 students would pass. We recommend a simple post hoc classification
 method based on discrete loss functions, that can lead to improved
 classification. We further propose that Cohen's weighted kappa statistic
 be used to evaluate the quality of the classification decisions.
 We illustrate the approach using Lenaburg's data.},
