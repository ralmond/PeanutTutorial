# Part 2: Example Bayesian Networks

# 1. Discrete Item Response Theory (IRT)

To fully specify the model, need:

-   Proficiency Model

-   Task/Evidence Models

-   Assembly Model

-   Some Numbers

# IRT Proficiency Model

-   There is one proficiency varaible, $\theta$ . (Sometimes called an "ability parameter", but we reserve the term *parameter* for quantites which are not person specific.)
-   $\theta$ takes on values $\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}$ with prior probabilities of (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1) (Triangular distribution).
-   Observable outcome variables are all independent given $\theta$
-   Goal is to draw inferences about $\theta$
    -   Rank order students by $\theta$
    -   Classify students according to $\theta$ above or below a cut point

## IRT Task/Evidence Model

Tasks yield an work product which can be unambiguously scored `right` or `wrong`.

Each task has a *single* observable outcome variable.

*Tasks* are often called *items,* although the common usage often blurs the distinction between the presentation of the item and the outcome variable.

## IRT (Rasch) Evidence Model

-   Let $X_j$ be observable outcome variable from Task $j$.
-   $\Pr(X_j =\text{right} | \theta, \beta_j) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\theta-\beta_j)}}$ - $\beta_j$ is the *difficulty* of the item.
-   Can crank through the formula for each of the five possible values of $\theta$ to get values for Conditional Probability Tables (CPT)

## IRT Assembly Model

5 items

Increasing difficulty:

$$ (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_5) = (-1.5, -0.75, 0, 0.75, 1.5)\ $$ .

```{r IRTtable}
irt1pl <- function(theta,beta) {
  1/(1+exp(beta-theta))
}
irt1pl(c(-2,-1,0,1,2),0)
```

Items are presented adaptively.

## Conditional Probability Tables

|  Î¸  | Prior | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|:---:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| -2  |  0.1  | 0.3775 | 0.2227 | 0.1192 | 0.0601 | 0.0293 |
| -1  |  0.2  | 0.6225 | 0.4378 | 0.2689 | 0.1480 | 0.0759 |
|  0  |  0.4  | 0.8176 | 0.6792 | 0.5000 | 0.3208 | 0.1824 |
|  1  |  0.2  | 0.9241 | 0.8520 | 0.7311 | 0.5622 | 0.3775 |
|  2  |  0.1  | 0.9707 | 0.9399 | 0.8088 | 0.7773 | 0.6225 |

## Problems Set 1

Use the network `CompensatoryConjunctiveNets/IRT5.dne` to answer these questions.

```{r launchNeticaIRT}
#|include: FALSE
#system("netica CompensatoryConjunctiveNets/IRT5.dne")
```

Inside Netica, to set a node to a value either, click on the value name, or right click and select the value.

To clear a value, click on it again, or right click and select "undefined".

1.  Assume $\theta =1$, what is expected score (sum $X_j$ )
2.  Calculate $P(\theta |X_1 \text{right})$, $E[\theta |X_1 =\text{right}]$.
3.  Calculate $P(\theta |X_5 = \text{right})$, $E[\theta |X_5 = \text{right}]$.
4.  Score three students who have the following observable patterns (Tasks 1\--5):

-   *1,1,1,0,0*
-   *1,0,0,1,1*
-   *1,1,1,0,1*

5.  Suppose we have observed for a given student $X_2 = \text{right}$ and $X_3=\text{right}$ , what is the next best item to present (hint, look for expected probabilities closest to .5,.5

6.  Same thing, with $X_2 = \text{right}$ and $X_3=\text{wrong}$

7.  Same thing, with $X_2 = \text{wrong}$ and $X_3=\text{wrong}$

# 2. "Context" effect --Testlets

-   Standard assumption of conditional independence of observable variables given Proficiency Variables
-   Violation
    -   Shared stimulus
    -   Context
    -   Special knowledge
    -   Shared Work Product
    -   Sequential dependencies
    -   Scoring Dependencies (Multi-step problem)
-   Testlets (Wainer & Kiely, 1987)
-   Violation results in overestimating the evidential value of observables for Proficiency Variables

## "Context" effect -- Variables

![IRT model with context effect](img/IRTC.dot.png)


-   Context variable -- A parent variable introduced to handle conditional dependence among observables (testlet)
    -   Consistent with Stout's (1987) 'essential n-dimensionality'
    -   Wang, Bradlow & Wainer (2001) SCORIGHT program for IRT
    -   Patz & Junker (1999) model for multiple ratings

## "Context" effect -- example

Suppose that Items 3 and 4 share common presentation material

Example: a word problem about "Yacht racing" might use nautical jargon like "leeward" and "tacking"

People familiar with the content area would have an advantage over people unfamiliar with the content area.

Would never us this example in practice because of DIF (Differential Item Functioning)

## Adding a context variable

Group Items 3 and 4 into a single task with two observed outcome variables

Add a person-specific, task-specific latent variable called "context" with values *familiar* and *unfamiliar*

Estimates of $\theta$ will "integrate out" the context effect

Can use as a mathematical trick to force dependencies between observables.

## IRT Model with Context Variable

Use the network `CompensatoryConjunctiveNets/IRT5C.dne` to answer these questions.

```{r launchNeticaIRTC}
#|include: FALSE
#system("netica CompensatoryConjunctiveNets/IRT5C.dne")
```

The CPTs in IRT5C have been set so that the marginal predictions (if the context is unknown), should have the same value.

![IRT model with Context Effect](img/IRTC.png)

## Problem Set 2

-   Compare the following quantities in the context and no context models:
    -   $P(X_2)$, $P(X_3)$, $P(X_4)$
    -   $P(\theta|X_2= \text{right})$, $P(\theta|X_3= \text{right} )$
    -   $P(X_4|X_2= \text{right} )$, $P(X_4 |X_3= \text{right} )$
    -   $P(\theta|X_3=\text{wrong}, X_4=\text{wrong})$, $P(\theta|X_3=\text{right}, X_4=\text{wrong})$,
    -   $P(\theta|X_3=\text{wrong}, X_4=\text{right})$, $P(\theta|X_3= \text{right}, X_4=\text{right})$

## Context Effect Postscript

If Context effect is generally construct-irrelevant variance, if correlated with group membership this is bad (DIF)

When calibrating using 2PL IRT model, can get similar joint distribution for $\theta$, $X_3$, and $X_4$ by decreasing the discrimination parameter

# 3. Combination Models

Consider a task which requires two Proficiencies:

Three different ways to combine those proficiencies:

**Compensatory** : More of Proficiency 1 compensates for less of Proficiency 2. Combination rule is *sum* .

**Conjunctive** : Both proficiencies are needed to solve the problem. Combination rule is *minimum.*

**Disjunctive** : Two proficiencies represent alternative solution paths to the problem. Combination rule is *maximum.*

# Combination Model Graphs

![CombinationModelNet](img/Combine3.png)

## Common Setup for All Three Models

There are two parent nodes, and both parents are conditionally independent of each other. The difference among the three models lies in the third term below:

$$P( P_1, P_2, X) = P( P_1) \cdot P(P_2) \cdot P(X| P_1,P_2 )$$

The priors for the parent nodes are the same for the three models with 0.3333 of probability at each of the H, M, and L states.

The initial marginal probability for X is the same for the three models (50/50).

## Conditional Probability Tables

This table contains the conditional probabilities for the parent nodes (P1 and P2) and the combination model for the three models.

`{r CPTcombine3 Pcomp <- c(H=.9,M=.5,L=.1) Pconj <- c(H=.9,M=.7,L=.3) Pdisj <- c(H=.7,M=.3,L=.1) cpts <- data.frame(P1=rep(names(Pcomp),each=3),P2=rep(names(Pcomp),3),                    Compensatory=as.vector(outer(Pcomp,Pcomp,"+")/2),                    Conjunctive=as.vector(outer(Pconj,Pconj,"min")),                    Disjunctive=as.vector(outer(Pdisj,Pdisj,"max"))) knitr::kable(cpts)`

## Problem Set 3

Use the network `CompensatoryConjunctiveNets/Comb3Same_1.dne` to answer these questions.

```{r launchNeticaC3}
#|include: FALSE
#system("netica CompensatoryConjunctiveNets/Comb3Same_1.dne")
```

1.  Verify that $P(P_1)$, $P(P_2)$ and $P(Obs)$ are the same for all three models. ( *Obs* represents either the node *Compensatory* , *Conjunctive,* or *Disjunctive* )

2.  Assume *Obs*=`right`; calculate $P(P_1)$ and $P(P_2)$ for all three models.

3.  Assume *Obs*=`wrong`; calculate $P(P_1)$ and $P(P_2)$ for all three models.

4.  Assume *Obs*=`right`, and $P_1$=`H`; Calculate $P(P_2)$ for all three models.

5.  Assume *Obs*=`right`, and $P_1$=`M`; Calculate $P(P_2)$ for all three models.

6.  Assume *Obs*=`right`, and $P_1$=`L`; Calculate $P(P_2)$ for all three models.

Explain the differences

## DiBello Models: A look ahead

Map states of parents to points on IRT $\theta$ scale.

Use *Compensatory* (average), *Conjunctive* (minimum) or *Disjunctive* (maximum) to combine effective thetas.

Use IRT (logistic) model to map to probabilities.

## Activity 3

-   Go back to the Driver's License Exam you built in Session I and add some numbers
-   Now put in some observed outcomes
    -   How did the probabilities change?
    -   Is that about what you expected?

    -   SME provided correlation and intercept
    -   SME has low confidence in numeric values

    -   Tasks Scored `right` / `Wrong`
    -   Based on IRT model
    -   *High* / *Medium* / *Low* corresponds to $\theta = +1, 0, -1$
    -   Easy/Medium/Hard corresponds to difficulty $-1, 0, +1$
    -   Discrimination of 1
    -   Used Q-Matrix to determine which node is parent

## PM-EM Algorithm for Scoring

-   Master Bayes net with just proficiency model(PM)
-   Database of Bayes net fragments corresponding to evidence models (EMs), indexed by task ID
-   To score a task:
    -   Find EM fragment corresponding to task
    -   Join EM fragment to PM
    -   Enter Evidence
    -   Absorb evidence from EM fragment into network
    -   Detach EM fragment

## An Example

![](img/2021%20BN%20Session%20II6.png)

Five proficiency variables

Three tasks, with observables {X11}, {X21, X22 , X23}, {X31}.

## Q: Which observables depend on which proficiency variables?

A: See the Q-matrix (Fischer, Tatsuoka).

|     | q1  | q2  | q3  | q4  | q5  | X23 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| X11 |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | --  |
| X21 |  0  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |
| X22 |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  1  |
| X23 |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | N/A |
| X31 |  0  |  1  |  1  |  1  |  0  | --  |

## Proficiency Model / Evidence Model Split

-   Full Bayes net for proficiency model and observables for all tasks can be decomposed into fragments.
    -   Proficiency model fragment(s) (PMFs) contain proficiency variables.
    -   An evidence model fragment (EMF) for each task.
    -   EMF contains observables for that task and all proficiency variables that are parents of any of them.
-   Presumes observables are conditionally independent between tasks, but can be dependent within tasks.
-   Allows for adaptively selecting tasks, docking EMF to PMF, and updating PMF on the fly.

## On the way to PMF and EMFs...

![](img/2021%20BN%20Session%20II11.png)

![](img/2021%20BN%20Session%20II12.png)

## Result:

-   Each EMF implies a join tree for Bayes net propagation.
    -   Initial distributions for proficiency variables are uniform.
-   The footprint of the PM in the EMF is a clique intersection between that EMF and the PMF.
-   Can "dock" EMFs with PMF one-at-a-time, to ...
    -   absorb evidence from values of observables to that task as updated probabilities for proficiency variables, and
    -   predict responses in new tasks, to evaluate potential evidentiary value of administering it.

## Docking evidence model fragments

# Weight of Evidence

Good (1985)

*H* is binary hypothesis, e.g., *Proficiency* \> *Medium*

*E* is evidence for hypothesis

## Properties of WOE

"Centibans" (log base 10, multiply by 100)

Positive for evidence supporting hypothesis, negative for evidence refuting hypothesis

Movement in tails of distribution as important as movement near center

![](img/2021%20BN%20Session%20II22.png)

## Task Selection Exercise 1

-   Use ACEDMotif1.dne
    -   Easy, Medium, and Hard tasks for Common Ratio and Visual Geometric
-   Use Hypothesis *SolveGeometricProblems* \> *Medium*
-   Calculate EWOE for six observables
-   Assume candidate gets first item right and repeat

Next assume candidate gets first item wrong and repeat

Repeat exercise using hypothesis *SolveGeometricProblems* \> *Low*

Use Network ACEDMotif2.dne

Select the *SolveGeometricProblems* node

Run the program Network\>Sensitivity to Findings

This will list the Mutual information for all nodes

Select the observable with the highest mutual information as the first task

Use this to process a person who gets every task right

Use this to process a person who gets every task wrong

## ACED Evaluation

-   Middle School Students
-   Did not normally study geometric series
-   Four conditions:
    -   Elaborated Feedback/Adaptive (E/A; n=71)
    -   Simple Feedback/Adaptive (S/A; n=75)
    -   Elaborated Feedback/Linear (E/L; n=67)
    -   Control (no instruction; n=55)
-   Students given all 61 geometric items
-   Also given pretest/posttest (25 items each)

## ACED Scores

![ACED Marginal Distributions](img/ACEDMargins.png)

-   For Each Proficiency Variable
    -   Marginal Distribution
    -   Modal Classification
    -   EAP Score (High=1, Low=-1)

## ACED Reliability

|        Proficiency (EAP)        | Reliability |
|:-------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| Solve Geometric Sequences (SGS) |    0.88     |
|        Find Common Ratio        |    0.90     |
|        Generate Examples        |    0.92     |
|         Extend Sequence         |    0.86     |
|         Model Sequence          |    0.80     |
|            Use Table            |    0.82     |
|          Use Pictures           |    0.82     |
|          Induce Rules           |    0.78     |
|          Number Right           |    0.88     |

Calculated with Split Halves (ECD design)

Correlation of EAP score with posttest is 0.65 (close to reliability of posttest)

Even with pretest forced into the equation, EAP score accounted for 17% unique variance

Reliability of modal classifications was worse

## Effect of Adaptivity

![ACED Validity by test length](img/ACEDValidityTestLength.png)

For adaptive conditions, correlation with posttest seems to hit upper limit by 20 items

Standard Error of Correlations is large

Jump in linear case related to sequence of items

## Effect of feedback

E/A showed significant gains

Others did not

Learning and assessment reliability!!!!!
