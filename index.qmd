This website contains the downloads and handouts for the tutorial *Bayesian Networks in Educational Assessment*. using the `Peanut` Bayesian network toolkit.

You can access this tutorial in two ways:

* Online viewing through <https://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/PeanutTutorial>. 

* Download the source code from <https://github.com/ralmond/PeanutTutorial.git>.

The latter allows you to reproduce the calculations on your own computer using R Studio. See the [Resources](Resources.qmd) page for more information about the software you need to download.

The complete tutorial has the following parts:

1.  [Introduction to Evidence-Centered Assessment Design and Bayesian Networks](ECD.qmd)

2.  [Example Bayesian Networks](BayesNets.qmd)

3.  Using Peanut to Manipulate Bayes nets
